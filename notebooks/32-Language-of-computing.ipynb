    "## Programming languages  \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Natural languages** are the languages people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Formal languages** are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:   \n",

    "**Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations.**  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Textual “code” files  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The set of formal statements that constitute a program are known as **code**. The programmer writes code into _files_ that are saved using a file extension that indicates the language the code is written in; examples include:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* _.py_ for Python  \n",
    "* _.c_ for C  \n",
    "* _.m_ for Matlab  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Note that they are **textual**, _i.e._, human-readable format (as opposed to machine code: a binary representation of the code).  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Syntax  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The formal programming languages have associated _syntax rules_ that come in two flavors: one pertaining to **tokens** and another to **structure** (how tokens may be combined, also known as **static semantics**). Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements. Programming languges differ greatly in both the specific form of the tokens used and the structures they may form.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "One of the most common error messages a programmer encounters when beginning to use a new language is the infamous: `Syntax Error`! For learners of natural languages, structural errors much more common are ;)  "

    "  \n",
    ">Formal languages are more dense than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Also, the structure is important, so it is not always best to read from top to bottom, left to right. Instead, learn to parse the program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure. Finally, the details matter. Small errors in spelling and punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language. (Downey, 2015)  \n",

    "### Comments  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Partly because programming languages have rather terse syntax (some are worse than others!), it is considered a _good custom_ to annotate the computational “business”-portions of programs with __comments__. Comments are portions of the _code_ that are not **parsed** by either the interpreter or the compiler, _i.e._, these are “left out” from the translation to machine instructions. Comments are thus exempt of syntax-checking and meaning-parsing applied to all other code.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Here is an example of a comment in the Python language. Whenever the hash-sign (‘#’) is encountered, parsing of the current line is stopped and the parser (interpreter or compiler) moves to the next line."
