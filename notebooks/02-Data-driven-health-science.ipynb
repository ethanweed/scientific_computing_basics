    "In [A Taxonomy of Data Science](http://www.dataists.com/2010/09/a-taxonomy-of-data-science/), Mason & Wiggins outline the following elements of actually 'doing science' with data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtain: pointing and clicking does not scale.\n",
    "2. Scrub: the world is a messy place\n",
    "    * a.k.a. '_data munging'_\n",
    "3. Explore: You can see a lot by looking\n",
    "4. Models: always bad, sometimes ugly\n",

    ">I'm not a statistician or a hacker and I don't know what 'munging' is. In fact, I don't give a rat's hiney about what a computer is or how it works, I just want 'The Results', please, so I can do the iNterpretation-bit and become famous!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation for the course\n",
    "\n",
    "The addition of the I(teration)-step to the OSEMN-model above is critical: __not one single analysis pipeline ever created was a linear process from data acquisition to publication!__ Correspondingly, each of the steps leading to any given _'result'_ have direct impact on the possible _interpretations_ one can make.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is therefore imperative that everyone involved in a data science workflow, _perhaps particularly those whose actions potentially have immediate concequences on human lives_, has a conceptual understanding of how results are obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "* the O- and S-steps entail choices of how to 'pre-process' data, including the choice to _discard_ data due to some (more-or-less _ad hoc_) criteria\n",
    "    * _are we basing our actions on some non-representative subset of data?_\n",
    "* the E-step is often practically difficult and time-consuming\n",
    "    * _why is it difficult?_ (what sort of practical challenges do face when 'computing'?)\n",
    "* the M-step is often 'someone else's expertise'\n",
    "    * _absolutely, but can you really use a tool without understanding how it's built?_\n",
